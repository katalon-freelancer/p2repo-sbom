This can be used to stop attackers from using the declared class property of Java enum objects to get access to the classloader. However this protection was not enabled by default. PropertyUtilsBean (and consequently BeanUtilsBean) now disallows declared class level property access by default.\n\n\n\n\n\nReleases 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 address a potential security issue when accessing enum properties in an uncontrolled way. If an application using Commons BeanUtils passes property paths from an external source directly to the getProperty() method of PropertyUtilsBean, an attacker can access the enum\u2019s class loader via the \u201cdeclaredClass\u201d property available on all Java \u201cenum\u201d objects. Accessing the enum\u2019s \u201cdeclaredClass\u201d allows remote attackers to access the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code. The same issue exists with PropertyUtilsBean.getNestedProperty().\nStarting in versions 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 a special BeanIntrospector suppresses the \u201cdeclaredClass\u201d property. Note that this new BeanIntrospector is enabled by default, but you can disable it to regain the old behavior; see section 2.5 of the user's guide and the unit tests.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Commons BeanUtils 1.x before 1.11.0, and 2.x before 2.0.0-M2.Users of the artifact commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils\n\n 1.x are recommended to upgrade to version 1.11.0, which fixes the issue.\n\n\nUsers of the artifact org.apache.commons:commons-beanutils2\n\n 2.x are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.0-M2, which fixes the issue.","id":"GHSA-wxr5-93ph-8wr9","published":"2025-05-28T15:34:34Z","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-wxr5-93ph-8wr9/GHSA-wxr5-93ph-8wr9.json","last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 1.10.1"},"package":{"ecosystem":"Maven","name":"commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils","purl":"pkg:maven/commons-beanutils/commons-beanutils"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.0"},{"fixed":"1.11.0"}]}],"versions":["1.0","1.10.0","1.10.1","1.2","1.3","1.4","1.4.1","1.5","1.6","1.6.1","1.7.0","1.8.0","1.8.0-BETA","1.8.1","1.8.2","1.8.3","1.9.0","1.9.1","1.9.2","1.9.3","1.9.4"]},{"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-wxr5-93ph-8wr9/GHSA-wxr5-93ph-8wr9.json"},"package":{"ecosystem":"Maven","name":"org.apache.commons:commons-beanutils2","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.commons/commons-beanutils2"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0-M1"},{"fixed":"2.0.0-M2"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-M1"]}]}]}

If the non-default `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option is enabled, HTML including `javascript:` URLs that have been crafted with control characters will not be sanitized. If the site that this HTML is published on does not set a Content Security Policy, an XSS attack is then possible.\n\n### Impact\nSites that accept input HTML from users and use jsoup to sanitize that HTML, may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, if they have enabled `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` and do not set an appropriate Content Security Policy.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue is patched in jsoup 1.15.3.\n\nUsers should upgrade to this version. Additionally, as the unsanitized input may have been persisted, old content should be cleaned again using the updated version.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo remediate this issue without immediately upgrading:\n\n- disable `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks`, which will rewrite input URLs as absolute URLs\n- ensure an appropriate [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is defined. (This should be used regardless of upgrading, as a defence-in-depth best practice.)\n\n### Background and root cause\njsoup includes a [Cleaner](https://jsoup.org/apidocs/org/jsoup/safety/Cleaner.html) component, which is designed to [sanitize input HTML](https://jsoup.org/cookbook/cleaning-html/safelist-sanitizer) against configurable safe-lists of acceptable tags, attributes, and attribute values.\n\nThis includes removing potentially malicious attributes such as `<a href=\"javascript:...\">`, which may enable XSS attacks. It does this by validating URL attributes against allowed URL protocols (e.g. `http`, `https`).\n\nHowever, an attacker may be able to bypass this check by embedding control characters into the href attribute value. This causes the Java URL class, which is used to resolve relative URLs to absolute URLs before checking the URL's protocol, to treat the URL as a relative URL. It is then resolved into an absolute URL with the configured base URI.\n\nFor example, `java\\tscript:...` would resolve to `https://example.com/java\\tscript:...`.\n\nBy default, when using a safe-list that allows `a` tags, jsoup will rewrite any relative URLs (e.g. `/foo/`) to an absolute URL (e.g. `https://example.com/foo/`). Therefore, this attack attempt would be successfully mitigated. However, if the option [SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks](https://jsoup.org/apidocs/org/jsoup/safety/Safelist.html#preserveRelativeLinks(boolean)) is enabled (which does not rewrite relative links to absolute), the input is left as-is.\n\nWhile Java will treat a path like `java\\tscript:` as a relative path, as it does not match the allowed characters of a URL spec, browsers may normalize out the control characters, and subsequently evaluate it as a `javascript:` spec inline expression. That disparity then leads to an XSS opportunity.\n\nSites defining a Content Security Policy that does not allow javascript expressions in link URLs will not be impacted, as the policy will prevent the script's execution.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup)\n* Email the author of jsoup at [jonathan@hedley.net](mailto:jonathan@hedley.net)\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Jens Häderer, who reported this issue, and contributed to its resolution.","id":"GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369","published":"2022-09-01T22:14:57Z","affected":[{"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/09/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369.json"},"package":{"ecosystem":"Maven","name":"org.jsoup:jsoup","purl":"pkg:maven/org.jsoup/jsoup"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.15.3"}]}],"versions":["0.2.1b","0.2.2","0.3.1","1.1.1","1.10.1","1.10.2","1.10.3","1.11.1","1.11.2","1.11.3","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.13.1","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.4.1","1.5.1","1.5.2","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.3","1.7.1","1.7.2","1.7.3","1.8.1","1.8.2","1.8.3","1.9.1","1.9.2"]}]}]}

PropertyUtilsBean (and consequently BeanUtilsBean) now disallows declared class level property access by default.\n\n\n\n\n\nReleases 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 address a potential security issue when accessing enum properties in an uncontrolled way. If an application using Commons BeanUtils passes property paths from an external source directly to the getProperty() method of PropertyUtilsBean, an attacker can access the enum’s class loader via the “declaredClass” property available on all Java “enum” objects. Accessing the enum’s “declaredClass” allows remote attackers to access the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code.
